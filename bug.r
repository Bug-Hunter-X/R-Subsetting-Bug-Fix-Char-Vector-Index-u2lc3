```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame using character vector indexing,
# but it uses incorrect syntax leading to unexpected results.

df <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = letters[1:3])

# Incorrect subsetting
result <- df["a", "b"]
print(result) # This will print the wrong thing. It will not subset rows based on column a
