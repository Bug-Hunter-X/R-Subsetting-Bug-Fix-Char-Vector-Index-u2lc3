# R Subsetting Bug: Incorrect Character Vector Indexing
This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming involving incorrect data frame subsetting using character vector indexing.  The `bug.r` file contains code that attempts to subset a data frame but uses incorrect syntax. The correct solution is provided in `bugSolution.r`.

## Problem
The issue lies in how the data frame is subsetted using character vectors. The provided code attempts to select a subset of the data frame based on both rows and columns, resulting in incorrect output.  Understanding how R interprets these operations is crucial for avoiding such errors.

## Solution
The solution explains the correct approach to subsetting data frames based on row or column names and provides alternative methods for achieving the desired outcome.
